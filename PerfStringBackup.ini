2=System
3=The System performance object consists of counters that apply to more than one instance of a component processors on the computer.
4=Memory
5=The Memory performance object  consists of counters that describe the behavior of physical and virtual memory on the computer.  Physical memory is the amount of random access memory on the computer.  Virtual memory consists of the space in physical memory and on disk.  Many of the memory counters monitor paging, which is the movement of pages of code and data between disk and physical memory.  Excessive paging, a symptom of a memory shortage, can cause delays which interfere with all system processes.
6=% Processor Time
7=% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends to execute a non-Idle thread. It is calculated by measuring the percentage of time that the processor spends executing the idle thread and then subtracting that value from 100%. (Each processor has an idle thread that consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). This counter is the primary indicator of processor activity, and displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It should be noted that the accounting calculation of whether the processor is idle is performed at an internal sampling interval of the system clock (10ms). On todays fast processors, % Processor Time can therefore underestimate the processor utilization as the processor may be spending a lot of time servicing threads between the system clock sampling interval. Workload based timer applications are one example  of applications  which are more likely to be measured inaccurately as timers are signaled just after the sample is taken.
9=% Total DPC Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs).  (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than the standard interrupts). It is the sum of Processor: % DPC Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total DPC Time is a component of System: % Total Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in privileged mode.  DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count.  This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
10=File Read Operations/sec
11=File Read Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to read from the file system cache.  It is measured in numbers of reads.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
12=File Write Operations/sec
13=File Write Operations/sec is the combined rate of the file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to write to data in the file system cache.  It is measured in numbers of writes. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
14=File Control Operations/sec
15=File Control Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, such as file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status.  This is the inverse of System: File Data Operations/sec and is measured in number of operations perf second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
16=File Read Bytes/sec
17=File Read Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are read to satisfy  file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including reads from the file system cache.  It is measured in number of bytes per second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
18=File Write Bytes/sec
19=File Write Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are written to satisfy file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including writes to the file system cache.  It is measured in number of bytes per second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
20=File Control Bytes/sec
21=File Control Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are transferred for all file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, including file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status.  It is measured in numbers of bytes.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
23=% Total Interrupt Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and servicing hardware interrupts during sample intervals, where the value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts. It is the sum of Processor: % Interrupt Time for of all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count.  This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices.
24=Available Bytes
25=Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory, in bytes, immediately available for allocation to a process or for system use. It is equal to the sum of memory assigned to the standby (cached), free and zero page lists. For a full explanation of the memory manager, refer to MSDN and/or the System Performance and Troubleshooting Guide chapter in the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit.
26=Committed Bytes
27=Committed Bytes is the amount of committed virtual memory, in bytes. Committed memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk paging file(s). There can be one or more paging files on each physical drive. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
28=Page Faults/sec
29=Page Faults/sec is the average number of pages faulted per second. It is measured in number of pages faulted per second because only one page is faulted in each fault operation, hence this is also equal to the number of page fault operations. This counter includes both hard faults (those that require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found elsewhere in physical memory.) Most processors can handle large numbers of soft faults without significant consequence. However, hard faults, which require disk access, can cause significant delays.
30=Commit Limit
31=Commit Limit is the amount of virtual memory that can be committed without having to extend the paging file(s).  It is measured in bytes. Committed memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk paging files. There can be one paging file on each logical drive). If the paging file(s) are be expanded, this limit increases accordingly.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
32=Write Copies/sec
33=Write Copies/sec is the rate at which page faults are caused by attempts to write that have been satisfied by coping of the page from elsewhere in physical memory. This is an economical way of sharing data since pages are only copied when they are written to; otherwise, the page is shared. This counter shows the number of copies, without regard for the number of pages copied in each operation.
34=Transition Faults/sec
35=Transition Faults/sec is the rate at which page faults are resolved by recovering pages that were being used by another process sharing the page, or were on the modified page list or the standby list, or were being written to disk at the time of the page fault. The pages were recovered without additional disk activity. Transition faults are counted in numbers of faults; because only one page is faulted in each operation, it is also equal to the number of pages faulted.
36=Cache Faults/sec
37=Cache Faults/sec is the rate at which faults occur when a page sought in the file system cache is not found and must be retrieved from elsewhere in memory (a soft fault) or from disk (a hard fault). The file system cache is an area of physical memory that stores recently used pages of data for applications. Cache activity is a reliable indicator of most application I/O operations. This counter shows the number of faults, without regard for the number of pages faulted in each operation.
38=Demand Zero Faults/sec
39=Demand Zero Faults/sec is the rate at which a zeroed page is required to satisfy the fault.  Zeroed pages, pages emptied of previously stored data and filled with zeros, are a security feature of Windows that prevent processes from seeing data stored by earlier processes that used the memory space. Windows maintains a list of zeroed pages to accelerate this process. This counter shows the number of faults, without regard to the number of pages retrieved to satisfy the fault. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
40=Pages/sec
41=Pages/sec is the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays.  It is the sum of Memory\\Pages Input/sec and Memory\\Pages Output/sec.  It is counted in numbers of pages, so it can be compared to other counts of pages, such as Memory\\Page Faults/sec, without conversion. It includes pages retrieved to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) non-cached mapped memory files.
42=Page Reads/sec
43=Page Reads/sec is the rate at which the disk was read to resolve hard page faults. It shows the number of reads operations, without regard to the number of pages retrieved in each operation. Hard page faults occur when a process references a page in virtual memory that is not in working set or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It includes read operations to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) and in non-cached mapped memory files. Compare the value of Memory\\Pages Reads/sec to the value of Memory\\Pages Input/sec to determine the average number of pages read during each operation.
44=Processor Queue Length
45=Processor Queue Length is the number of threads in the processor queue.  Unlike the disk counters, this counter counters, this counter shows ready threads only, not threads that are running.  There is a single queue for processor time even on computers with multiple processors. Therefore, if a computer has multiple processors, you need to divide this value by the number of processors servicing the workload. A sustained processor queue of less than 10 threads per processor is normally acceptable, dependent of the workload.
46=Thread State
47=Thread State is the current state of the thread.  It is 0 for Initialized, 1 for Ready, 2 for Running, 3 for Standby, 4 for Terminated, 5 for Wait, 6 for Transition, 7 for Unknown.  A Running thread is using a processor; a Standby thread is about to use one.  A Ready thread wants to use a processor, but is waiting for a processor because none are free.  A thread in Transition is waiting for a resource in order to execute, such as waiting for its execution stack to be paged in from disk.  A Waiting thread has no use for the processor because it is waiting for a peripheral operation to complete or a resource to become free.
48=Pages Output/sec
49=Pages Output/sec is the rate at which pages are written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written back to disk only if they are changed in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code. A high rate of pages output might indicate a memory shortage. Windows writes more pages back to disk to free up space when physical memory is in short supply.  This counter shows the number of pages, and can be compared to other counts of pages, without conversion.
50=Page Writes/sec
51=Page Writes/sec is the rate at which pages are written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written to disk only if they are changed while in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code.  This counter shows write operations, without regard to the number of pages written in each operation.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
52=Browser
53=The Browser performance object consists of counters that measure the rates of announcements, enumerations, and other Browser transmissions.
54=Announcements Server/sec
55=Announcements Server/sec is the rate at which the servers in this domain have announced themselves to this server.
56=Pool Paged Bytes
57=Pool Paged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the paged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used.  Memory\\Pool Paged Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool Paged Bytes, so it might not equal Process\\Pool Paged Bytes\\_Total. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
58=Pool Nonpaged Bytes
59=Pool Nonpaged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the nonpaged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that cannot be written to disk, but must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.  Memory\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes, so it might not equal Process\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes\\_Total.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
60=Pool Paged Allocs
61=Pool Paged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the paged pool. The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
63=Pool Paged Resident Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the paged pool. The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. Space used by the paged and nonpaged pools are taken from physical memory, so a pool that is too large denies memory space to processes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
64=Pool Nonpaged Allocs
65=Pool Nonpaged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the nonpaged pool. The nonpaged pool is an area of system memory area for objects that cannot be written to disk, and must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.  It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
66=Pool Paged Resident Bytes
67=Bytes Total/sec is the total rate of bytes sent to or received from the network by the protocol, but only for the frames (packets) which carry data. This is the sum of Frame Bytes/sec and Datagram Bytes/sec.
68=System Code Total Bytes
69=System Code Total Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable operating system code currently in virtual memory. It is a measure of the amount of physical memory being used by the operating system that can be written to disk when not in use. This value is calculated by summing the bytes in Ntoskrnl.exe, Hal.dll, the boot drivers, and file systems loaded by Ntldr/osloader.  This counter does not include code that must remain in physical memory and cannot be written to disk. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
70=System Code Resident Bytes
71=System Code Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes of the operating system code currently in physical memory that can be written to disk when not in use. This value is a component of Memory\\System Code Total Bytes, which also includes operating system code on disk. Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes (and Memory\\System Code Total Bytes) does not include code that must remain in physical memory and cannot be written to disk. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
72=System Driver Total Bytes
73=System Driver Total Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable virtual memory currently being used by device drivers. Pageable memory can be written to disk when it is not being used. It includes physical memory (Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes) and code and data paged to disk. It is a component of Memory\\System Code Total Bytes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
74=System Driver Resident Bytes
75=System Driver Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable physical memory being used by device drivers. It is the working set (physical memory area) of the drivers. This value is a component of Memory\\System Driver Total Bytes, which also includes driver memory that has been written to disk. Neither Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes nor Memory\\System Driver Total Bytes includes memory that cannot be written to disk.
76=System Cache Resident Bytes
77=System Cache Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable operating system code in the file system cache. This value includes only current physical pages and does not include any virtual memory pages not currently resident. It does equal the System Cache value shown in Task Manager. As a result, this value may be smaller than the actual amount of virtual memory in use by the file system cache. This value is a component of Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes which represents all pageable operating system code that is currently in physical memory. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
78=Announcements Domain/sec
79=Announcements Domain/sec is the rate at which a domain has announced itself to the network.
80=Election Packets/sec
81=Election Packets/sec is the rate at which browser election packets have been received by this workstation.
82=Mailslot Writes/sec
83=Mailslot Writes/sec is the rate at which mailslot messages have been successfully received.
84=Server List Requests/sec
85=Server List Requests/sec is the rate at which requests to retrieve a list of browser servers have been processed by this workstation.
86=Cache
87=The Cache performance object  consists of counters that monitor the file system cache, an area of physical memory that stores recently used data as long as possible to permit access to the data without having to read from the disk.  Because applications typically use the cache, the cache is monitored as an indicator of application I/O operations.  When memory is plentiful, the cache can grow, but when memory is scarce, the cache can become too small to be effective.
88=Data Maps/sec
89=Data Maps/sec is the frequency that a file system such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page.
90=Sync Data Maps/sec
91=Sync Data Maps/sec counts the frequency that a file system, such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page, and wishes to wait for the page to be retrieved if it is not in main memory.
92=Async Data Maps/sec
93=Async Data Maps/sec is the frequency that an application using a file system, such as NTFS, to map a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page, and does not wait for the page to be retrieved if it is not in main memory.
94=Data Map Hits %
95=Data Map Hits is the percentage of data maps in the file system cache that could be resolved without having to retrieve a page from the disk, because the page was already in physical memory.
96=Data Map Pins/sec
97=Data Map Pins/sec is the frequency of data maps in the file system cache that resulted in pinning a page in main memory, an action usually preparatory to writing to the file on disk.   While pinned, a page's physical address in main memory and virtual address in the file system cache will not be altered.
98=Pin Reads/sec
99=Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk.  Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the read.  While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.
100=Sync Pin Reads/sec
101=Sync Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk.  Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the read.  The file system will not regain control until the page is pinned in the file system cache, in particular if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the page.  While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.
102=Async Pin Reads/sec
103=Async Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk.  Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the read.  The file system will regain control immediately even if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the page.  While pinned, a page's physical address will not be altered.
104=Pin Read Hits %
105=Pin Read Hits is the percentage of pin read requests that hit the file system cache, i.e., did not require a disk read in order to provide access to the page in the file system cache.  While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving data from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is usually the method used by the disk file systems as well.
106=Copy Reads/sec
107=Copy Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from pages of the file system cache that involve a memory copy of the data from the cache to the application's buffer.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving information from the file system cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is a method used by the disk file systems as well.
108=Sync Copy Reads/sec
109=Sync Copy Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from pages of the file system cache that involve a memory copy of the data from the cache to the application's buffer.  The file system will not regain control until the copy operation is complete, even if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the page.
110=Async Copy Reads/sec
111=Async Copy Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from pages of the file system cache that involve a memory copy of the data from the cache to the application's buffer.  The application will regain control immediately even if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the page.
112=Copy Read Hits %
113=Copy Read Hits is the percentage of cache copy read requests that hit the cache, that is, they did not require a disk read in order to provide access to the page in the cache.  A copy read is a file read operation that is satisfied by a memory copy from a page in the cache to the application's buffer.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving information from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is a method used by the disk file systems as well.
114=MDL Reads/sec
115=MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the data.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page involved in the transfer, and thus can employ a hardware Direct Memory Access (DMA) device to effect the copy.  The LAN Server uses this method for large transfers out of the server.
116=Sync MDL Reads/sec
117=Sync MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages.  If the accessed page(s) are not in main memory, the caller will wait for the pages to fault in from the disk.
118=Async MDL Reads/sec
119=Async MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages.  If the accessed page(s) are not in main memory, the calling application program will not wait for the pages to fault in from disk.
120=MDL Read Hits %
121=MDL Read Hits is the percentage of Memory Descriptor List (MDL) Read requests to the file system cache that hit the cache, i.e., did not require disk accesses in order to provide memory access to the page(s) in the cache.
122=Read Aheads/sec
123=Read Aheads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache in which the Cache detects sequential access to a file.  The read aheads permit the data to be transferred in larger blocks than those being requested by the application, reducing the overhead per access.
124=Fast Reads/sec
125=Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.
126=Sync Fast Reads/sec
127=Sync Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.  If the data is not in the cache, the request (application program call) will wait until the data has been retrieved from disk.
128=Async Fast Reads/sec
129=Async Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests will invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits data to be retrieved from the cache directly (without file system involvement) if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.  If the data is not in the cache, the request (application program call) will not wait until the data has been retrieved from disk, but will get control immediately.
130=Fast Read Resource Misses/sec
131=Fast Read Resource Misses/sec is the frequency of cache misses necessitated by the lack of available resources to satisfy the request.
132=Fast Read Not Possibles/sec
133=Fast Read Not Possibles/sec is the frequency of attempts by an Application Program Interface (API) function call to bypass the file system to get to data in the file system cache that could not be honored without invoking the file system.
134=Lazy Write Flushes/sec
135=Lazy Write Flushes/sec is the rate at which the Lazy Writer thread has written to disk.  Lazy Writing is the process of updating the disk after the page has been changed in memory, so that the application that changed the file does not have to wait for the disk write to be complete before proceeding.  More than one page can be transferred by each write operation.
136=Lazy Write Pages/sec
137=Lazy Write Pages/sec is the rate at which the Lazy Writer thread has written to disk.  Lazy Writing is the process of updating the disk after the page has been changed in memory, so that the application that changed the file does not have to wait for the disk write to be complete before proceeding.  More than one page can be transferred on a single disk write operation.
138=Data Flushes/sec
139=Data Flushes/sec is the rate at which the file system cache has flushed its contents to disk as the result of a request to flush or to satisfy a write-through file write request.  More than one page can be transferred on each flush operation.
140=Data Flush Pages/sec
141=Data Flush Pages/sec is the number of pages the file system cache has flushed to disk as a result of a request to flush or to satisfy a write-through file write request.  More than one page can be transferred on each flush operation.
142=% User Time
143=% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time the processor spends in the user mode. User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems.  The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services. This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
144=% Privileged Time
145=% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
146=Context Switches/sec
147=Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.  Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service.  It is the sum of Thread\\Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches.  There are context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
148=Interrupts/sec
149=Interrupts/sec is the average rate, in incidents per second, at which the processor received and serviced hardware interrupts. It does not include deferred procedure calls (DPCs), which are counted separately. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards, and other peripheral devices. These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended. The system clock typically interrupts the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
150=System Calls/sec
151=System Calls/sec is the combined rate of calls to operating system service routines by all processes running on the computer. These routines perform all of the basic scheduling and synchronization of activities on the computer, and provide access to non-graphic devices, memory management, and name space management. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
152=Level 1 TLB Fills/sec
153=Level 1 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).  On some computers this fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is incremented.
154=Level 2 TLB Fills/sec
155=Level 2 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), nor is the page containing the PTE.  On some computers this fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is incremented.
156=Enumerations Server/sec
157=% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in user mode. Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode. Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows executive, kernel, and device drivers. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
158=Enumerations Domain/sec
159=% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode. When a Windows system service is called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.

172=Virtual Bytes Peak
173=Virtual Bytes Peak is the maximum size, in bytes, of virtual address space the process has used at any one time. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. However, virtual space is finite, and the process might limit its ability to load libraries.
174=Virtual Bytes
175=Virtual Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its ability to load libraries.
177=Page Faults/sec is the rate at which page faults by the threads executing in this process are occurring.  A page fault occurs when a thread refers to a virtual memory page that is not in its working set in main memory. This may not cause the page to be fetched from disk if it is on the standby list and hence already in main memory, or if it is in use by another process with whom the page is shared.
178=Working Set Peak
179=Working Set Peak is the maximum size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process at any point in time. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before they leave main memory.
180=Working Set
181=Working Set is the current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before leaving main memory.
182=Page File Bytes Peak
183=Page File Bytes Peak is the maximum amount of virtual memory, in bytes, that this process has reserved for use in the paging file(s). Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files.  Paging files are shared by all processes, and the lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory. If there is no paging file, this counter reflects the maximum amount of virtual memory that the process has reserved for use in physical memory.
184=Page File Bytes
185=Page File Bytes is the current amount of virtual memory, in bytes, that this process has reserved for use in the paging file(s). Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and the lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory. If there is no paging file, this counter reflects the current amount of virtual memory that the process has reserved for use in physical memory.
186=Private Bytes
187=Private Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes.
188=Announcements Total/sec
189=% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
190=Enumerations Total/sec
191=% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
193=% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in user mode.  Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode.  Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in your process.
195=% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
197=Context Switches/sec is the rate of switches from one thread to another.  Thread switches can occur either inside of a single process or across processes.  A thread switch can be caused either by one thread asking another for information, or by a thread being preempted by another, higher priority thread becoming ready to run.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of an application  appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the application.  Switching to the subsystem process causes one Context Switch in the application thread.  Switching back causes another Context Switch in the subsystem thread.
198=Current Disk Queue Length
199=Current Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected. It also includes requests in service at the time of the collection. This is a instantaneous snapshot, not an average over the time interval. Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests that are active at one time, but other concurrent requests are awaiting service. This counter might reflect a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests experience delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the number of spindles on the disks. For good performance, this difference should average less than two.
200=% Disk Time
201=% Disk Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive was busy servicing read or write requests.

232=Thread
233=The Thread performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of thread behavior.  A thread is the basic object that executes instructions on a processor.  All running processes have at least one thread.
234=PhysicalDisk
235=The Physical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor hard or fixed disk drive on a computer.  Disks are used to store file, program, and paging data and are read to retrieve these items, and written to record changes to them.  The values of physical disk counters are sums of the values of the logical disks (or partitions) into which they are divided.
236=LogicalDisk
237=The Logical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor logical partitions of a hard or fixed disk drives.  Performance Monitor identifies logical disks by their a drive letter, such as C.
238=Processor
239=The Processor performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of processor activity.

A computer can have multiple processors.  The processor object represents each processor as an instance of the object.
240=% Total Processor Time
241=% Total Processor Time is the average percentage of time that all processors on the computer are executing non-idle threads.   This counter was designed as the primary indicator of processor activity on multiprocessor computers.  It is equal to the sum of Process: % Processor Time for all processors, divided by the number of processors.  It is calculated by summing the time that all processors spend executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, subtracting that value from 100%, and dividing the difference by the number of processors on the computer.  (Each processor has an Idle thread which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). For example, on a multiprocessor computer, a value of 50% means that all processors are busy for half of the sample interval, or that half of the processors are busy for all of the sample interval.  This counter displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval.  It is calculated by monitoring the time the service was inactive, and then subtracting that value from 100%.
242=% Total User Time
243=% Total User Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in user mode.  It is the sum of Processor: % User Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%.  (User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems.  The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services). This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
244=% Total Privileged Time
245=% Total Privileged Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in privileged (kernel) mode.  It is the sum of Processor: % Privileged Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%.  (Privileged mode is an processing mode designed for operating system components which allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services.  The alternative, user mode, is a restricted processing mode designed for applications and environment subsystems). This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
246=Total Interrupts/sec
247=Total Interrupts/sec is the combined rate of hardware interrupts received and serviced by all processors on the computer It is the sum of Processor: Interrupts/sec for all processors, and divided by the number of processors, and is measured in numbers of interrupts.  It does not include DPCs, which are counted separately.  This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices.  These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention.  Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts.  Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
248=Processes

252=Events
253=Events is the number of events in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  An event is used when two or more threads try to synchronize execution.
254=Semaphores
255=Semaphores is the number of semaphores in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Threads use semaphores to obtain exclusive access to data structures that they share with other threads.
256=Mutexes
257=Mutexes counts the number of mutexes in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Mutexes are used by threads to assure only one thread is executing a particular section of code.
258=Sections
259=Sections is the number of sections in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  A section is a portion of virtual memory created by a process for storing data. A process can share sections with other processes.
260=Objects
261=The Object performance object consists of counters that monitor  logical objects in the system, such as processes, threads, mutexes, and semaphores.

266=Packets Received/sec
267=Packets Received/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is receiving packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks).  Network transmissions are divided into packets.  The average number of bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Received/sec by this counter.  Some packets received might not contain incoming data (for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the Redirector would count as an incoming packet).
268=Read Bytes Paging/sec
269=Read Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to read bytes in response to page faults.  Page faults are caused by loading of modules (such as programs and libraries), by a miss in the Cache (see Read Bytes Cache/sec), or by files directly mapped into the address space of applications (a high-performance feature of Windows NT).
270=Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec
271=Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec are those bytes read by the Redirector in response to normal file requests by an application when they are redirected to come from another computer.

This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
272=Read Bytes Cache/sec
273=Read Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications are accessing the file system cache by using the Redirector.  Some of these data requests are satisfied by retrieving the data from the cache.  Requests that miss the Cache cause a page fault (see Read Bytes Paging/sec).
274=Read Bytes Network/sec
275=Read Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are reading data across the network. This occurs when data sought in the file system cache is not found there and must be retrieved from the network.  Dividing this value by Bytes Received/sec indicates the proportion of application data traveling across the network. (see Bytes Received/sec).

280=Write Bytes Paging/sec
281=Write Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to write bytes changed in the pages being used by applications.  The program data changed by modules (such as programs and libraries) that were loaded over the network are 'paged out' when no longer needed.  Other output pages come from the file system cache (see Write Bytes Cache/sec).
282=Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec
283=Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec is the rate at which bytes are written by the Redirector in response to normal file outputs by an application when they are redirected to another computer.  In addition to file requests, this count includes other methods of writing across the network, such as Named Pipes and Transactions.  This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
284=Write Bytes Cache/sec
285=Write Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications on your computer are writing to the file system cache by using the Redirector.  The data might not leave your computer immediately; it can be retained in the cache for further modification before being written to the network.  This saves network traffic.  Each write of a byte into the cache is counted here.
286=Write Bytes Network/sec
287=Write Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are writing data across the network. This occurs when the file system cache is bypassed, such as for Named Pipes or Transactions, or when the cache writes the bytes to disk to make room for other data.  Dividing this counter by Bytes Transmitted/sec will indicate the proportion of application data being to the network (see Transmitted Bytes/sec).
288=Read Operations/sec
289=File Read Operations/sec is the rate at which applications are asking the Redirector for data. Each call to a file system or similar Application Program Interface (API) call counts as one operation.
290=Read Operations Random/sec
291=Read Operations Random/sec counts the rate at which, on a file-by-file basis, reads are made that are not sequential.  If a read is made using a particular file handle, and then is followed by another read that is not immediately the contiguous next byte, this counter is incremented by one.
292=Read Packets/sec
293=Read Packets/sec is the rate at which read packets are being placed on the network.  Each time a single packet is sent with a request to read data remotely, this counter is incremented by one.
294=Reads Large/sec
295=Reads Large/sec is the rate at which reads over 2 times the server's negotiated buffer size are made by applications.  Too many of these could place a strain on server resources.  This counter is incremented once for each read. It does not count packets.
296=Read Packets Small/sec
297=Read Packets Small/sec is the rate at which reads less than one-fourth of the server's negotiated buffer size are made by applications.  Too many of these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server.  This counter is incremented once for each read. It does not count packets.
298=Write Operations/sec
299=File Write Operations/sec is the rate at which applications are sending data to the Redirector. Each call to a file system or similar Application Program Interface (API) call counts as one operation.
300=Write Operations Random/sec
301=Write Operations Random/sec is the rate at which, on a file-by-file basis, writes are made that are not sequential.  If a write is made using a particular file handle, and then is followed by another write that is not immediately the next contiguous byte, this counter is incremented by one.
302=Write Packets/sec
303=Write Packets/sec is the rate at which writes are being sent to the network.  Each time a single packet is sent with a request to write remote data, this counter is incremented by one.
304=Writes Large/sec
305=Writes Large/sec is the rate at which writes are made by applications that are over 2 times the server's negotiated buffer size.  Too many of these could place a strain on server resources.  This counter is incremented once for each write: it counts writes, not packets.
306=Write Packets Small/sec
307=Write Packets Small/sec is the rate at which writes are made by applications that are less than one-fourth of the server's negotiated buffer size.  Too many of these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server.  This counter is incremented once for each write: it counts writes, not packets.
308=Reads Denied/sec
309=Reads Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Reads.  When a read is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Read which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet.  To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.
310=Writes Denied/sec
311=Writes Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Writes.  When a write is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Write which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet.  To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.
312=Network Errors/sec

5042=.NET CLR Memory
5043=Counters for CLR Garbage Collected heap.
5044=# Gen 0 Collections
5045=This counter displays the number of times the generation 0 objects (youngest; most recently allocated) are garbage collected (Gen 0 GC) since the start of the application. Gen 0 GC occurs when the available memory in generation 0 is not sufficient to satisfy an allocation request. This counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 0 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 1 or Gen 2) GC occurs. _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5046=# Gen 1 Collections
5047=This counter displays the number of times the generation 1 objects are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 1 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 2) GC occurs. _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5048=# Gen 2 Collections
5049=This counter displays the number of times the generation 2 objects (older) are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 2 GC (also called full GC). _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5050=Promoted Memory from Gen 0
5051=This counter displays the bytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter.

5052=Promoted Memory from Gen 1
5053=This counter displays the bytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter. This counter is reset to 0 if the last GC was a Gen 0 GC only.
5054=Gen 0 Promoted Bytes/Sec
5055=This counter displays the bytes per second that are promoted from generation 0 (youngest) to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. This counter was designed as an indicator of relatively long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5056=Gen 1 Promoted Bytes/Sec
5057=This counter displays the bytes per second that are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2 (oldest); objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. Nothing is promoted from generation 2 since it is the oldest. This counter was designed as an indicator of very long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5058=Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 0
5059=This counter displays the bytes of memory that are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1 just because they are waiting to be finalized. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter.

5062=Gen 0 heap size
5063=This counter displays the maximum bytes that can be allocated in generation 0 (Gen 0); its does not indicate the current number of bytes allocated in Gen 0. A Gen 0 GC is triggered when the allocations since the last GC exceed this size. The Gen 0 size is tuned by the Garbage Collector and can change during the execution of the application. At the end of a Gen 0 collection the size of the Gen 0 heap is infact 0 bytes; this counter displays the size (in bytes) of allocations that would trigger the next Gen 0 GC. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5064=Gen 1 heap size
5065=This counter displays the current number of bytes in generation 1 (Gen 1); this counter does not display the maximum size of Gen 1. Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from previous Gen 0 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5066=Gen 2 heap size
5067=This counter displays the current number of bytes in generation 2 (Gen 2). Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from Gen 1 during previous Gen 1 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5068=Large Object Heap size
5069=This counter displays the current size of the Large Object Heap in bytes. Objects greater than 20 KBytes are treated as large objects by the Garbage Collector and are directly allocated in a special heap; they are not promoted through the generations. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5070=Finalization Survivors
5071=This counter displays the number of garbage collected objects that survive a collection because they are waiting to be finalized. If these objects hold references to other objects then those objects also survive but are not counted by this counter; the "Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 0" and "Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 1" counters represent all the memory that survived due to finalization. This counter is not a cumulative counter; its updated at the end of every GC with count of the survivors during that particular GC only. This counter was designed to indicate the extra overhead that the application might incur because of finalization.
5072=# GC Handles
5073=This counter displays the current number of GC Handles in use. GCHandles are handles to resources external to the CLR and the managed environment. Handles occupy small amounts of memory in the GCHeap but potentially expensive unmanaged resources.
5074=Allocated Bytes/sec
5075=This counter displays the rate of bytes per second allocated on the GC Heap. This counter is updated at the end of every GC; not at each allocation. This counter is not an average over time; it displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5076=# Induced GC
5077=This counter displays the peak number of times a garbage collection was performed because of an explicit call to GC.Collect. Its a good practice to let the GC tune the frequency of its collections.
5078=% Time in GC
5079=% Time in GC is the percentage of elapsed time that was spent in performing a garbage collection (GC) since the last GC cycle. This counter is usually an indicator of the work done by the Garbage Collector on behalf of the application to collect and compact memory. This counter is updated only at the end of every GC and the counter value reflects the last observed value; its not an average.
5080=Not Displayed
5081=Not Displayed.
5082=# Bytes in all Heaps
5083=This counter is the sum of four other counters; Gen 0 Heap Size; Gen 1 Heap Size; Gen 2 Heap Size and the Large Object Heap Size. This counter indicates the current memory allocated in bytes on the GC Heaps.
5084=# Total committed Bytes
5085=This counter displays the amount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently committed by the Garbage Collector. (Committed memory is the physical memory for which space has been reserved on the disk paging file).
5086=# Total reserved Bytes
5087=This counter displays the amount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently reserved by the Garbage Collector. (Reserved memory is the virtual memory space reserved for the application but no disk or main memory pages have been used.)
5088=# of Pinned Objects
5089=This counter displays the number of pinned objects encountered in the last GC. This counter tracks the pinned objects only in the heaps that were garbage collected e.g. a Gen 0 GC would cause enumeration of pinned objects in the generation 0 heap only. A pinned object is one that the Garbage Collector cannot move in memory.
5090=# of Sink Blocks in use
5091=This counter displays the current number of sync blocks in use. Sync blocks are per-object data structures allocated for storing synchronization information. Sync blocks hold weak references to managed objects and need to be scanned by the Garbage Collector. Sync blocks are not limited to storing synchronization information and can also store COM interop metadata. This counter was designed to indicate performance problems with heavy use of synchronization primitives.

[PerfStrings_0804]
1=1847
2=System
3=该系统性能对象包含应用于计算机上多个组件处理器实例的计数器。
4=Memory
5=Memory performance object 由描述计算机上的物理和虚拟内存行为的计数器组成。物理内存指计算机上的随机存取存储器的数量。虚拟内存由物理内存和磁盘上的空间组成。许多内存计数器监视页面调度(指磁盘与物理内存之的代码和数据页的移动)。过多的页面调度(内存不足的一种表现)可引起拖延，会影响整个系统处理效率。
6=% Processor Time
7=% Processor Time 指处理器用来执行非闲置线程时间的百分比。计算方法是，度量处理器用来执行空闲线程的时间，然后用 100% 减去该值。(每个处理器有一个空闲线程，该线程在没有其他线程可以运行时消耗周期)。此计数器是处理器活动的主要指示器，显示在采样间隔期间所观察的繁忙时间平均百分比。应注意，对处理器是否空闲的计算是在系统时钟的内部采样间隔期间(10ms)执行的。考虑到现在的处理器速度非常快，因此，在处理器可能会用大量时间为系统时钟采样间隔之间的线程提供服务时，% Processor Time 会低估处理器利用率。当恰好进行采样后即向计时器发出信号时，更可能对应用程序做出不准确地度量，基于工作负荷的计时器应用程序是一个这样的示例。
9=% Total DPC Time 指所有处理器用于接收和为延缓的过程调用(DPCs) 提供服务的平均时间的百分比。(DPC 指以低于标准间隔优先权运行的那些间隔)。它是指在该计算机上的所有处理器的 Processor: % DPC Time 的总数。由于 DPS 是以特权模式执行， System: % Total DPC Time 为 System: % Total Privileged Time 的组件。DPC 是分别计数的并且不是间隔计算的组件。这个计数值将平均忙时作为实例时间的一部分以百分率显示。
10=File Read Operations/sec
11=File Read Operations/sec 指对计算机上的所有设备的文件系统读取请求(包括请求从文件系统缓存中的读取)的综合速率。它是用读取数目来衡量的。此计数器显示上两个采样中观察到的值的差除以采样间隔时间所得的值。
12=File Write Operations/sec
13=File Write Operations/sec 指计算机上所有设备的文件系统写入请求(包括请求从文件系统缓存中的写入)的综合速率。用写入数来计算。这个计数器显示用上两个实例中观察到的值之间的差除于实例间隔的持续时间所得的值。
14=File Control Operations/sec
15=File Control Operations/sec 指那些既不是读取也不是写入的文件系统操作(如文件系统控制请求和对有关设备性能和状态信息的请求)的综合速率。这是 System: File Data Operations/sec 的逆转，用每秒操作数来衡量。此计数器显示上两个采样中观察到的值的差除以采样间隔时间所得的值。
16=File Read Bytes/sec
17=File Read Bytes/sec 指满足计算机上所有设备文件系统读取请求(包括从文件系统缓存的读取)的读取字节的总速率。它是用每秒字节数来衡量的。此计数器显示上两个采样中观察到的值的差除以采样间隔时间所得的值。
18=File Write Bytes/sec
19=File Write Bytes/sec 指满足计算机上所有设备的文件系统写入请求(包括写入文件系统缓存)的写入字节的总速率。它是用每秒字节数来衡量的。此计数器显示上两个采样中观察到的值的差除以采样间隔时间所得的值。
20=File Control Bytes/sec
21=File Control Bytes/sec 指在所有既不是读取也不是写入的文件系统操作(包括系统控制请求和对有关设备性能和状态信息的请求)中传输字节的总速率。它是用每秒字节数来衡量的。此计数器显示上两个采样中观察到的值的差除以采样间隔时间所得的值。
23=% Total Interrupt Time 指所有处理器在采样间隔内用于接收硬件中断并为其提供服务的平均时间的百分比；该值间接指示生成中断的设备的活动。它是用计算机上的所有处理器的 Processor: % Interrupt Time 的总和除以处理器的数目得出的。DPC 是分开计算的，不作为中断计算的一部分。此值是生成中断的设备活动(如系统计时器、鼠标、磁盘驱动程序、数据通讯线、网络接口卡和其他外围设备)的间接指示符。
24=Available Bytes
25=Available Bytes 是指以字节表示的物理内存数量。此内存能立刻分配给一个进程或系统使用。它等于分配给待机(缓存的)、空闲和零分页列表内存的总和。要获得内存管理器的详细解释，请参阅 MSDN 和/或 Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit 里的系统性能和疑难解答指南章节。
26=Committed Bytes
27=Committed Byte 是指以字节表示的确认虚拟内存。确认内存磁盘页面文件上保留了空间的物理内存。每个物理磁盘上可以有一个或一个以上的页面文件。这个计数器只显示上一回观察到的值；它不是一个平均值。
28=Page Faults/sec
29=Page Faults/sec 是每秒钟出错页面的平均数量。由于每个错误操作中只有一个页面出错，计算单位为每秒出错页面数量，因此这也等于页面错误操作的数量。这个计数器包括硬错误(那些需要磁盘访问的)和软错误(在物理内存的其他地方找到的错误页)。许多处理器可以在有大量软错误的情况下继续操作。但是，硬错误可以导致明显的拖延。
30=Commit Limit
31=Commit Limit 是指在不用扩展分页文件的情况下可以使用的虚拟内存的数量。这是用字节来计算的。确认的内存是指保留在磁盘分页文件上的物理内存。在每个逻辑磁盘上可以有一个分页内存。如果扩展分页文件，这个限量将相应增加。这个计数器只显示上一回观察到的值；而不是一个平均值。
32=Write Copies/sec
33=Write Copies/sec 是指使用物理内存中的其他空间复制页以满足写入的尝试而引起的页面错误速度。由于页只在写入时才复制，这是一个实用的共享数据的方式；否则需要共享该页。这个计数器在不计算每次操作时复制的页数的情况下显示复制的数量。
34=Transition Faults/sec
35=Transition Faults/sec is 是恢复页面解析页面错误的速度。此恢复页面正被另一个共享此页面进程使用，或在被修改的页面列表或待机列表上，或在发生页面错误时正被写入磁盘。在没有额外磁盘运行的情况下，页面已被恢复。中转错误以错误数量计算，因为每一操作只有一个页面错误，它也等于错误的页面数量。
36=Cache Faults/sec
37=Cache Faults/sec 指在文件系统缓存中找不到要寻找的页而需要从内存(软错误)的其他地方或从磁盘(硬错误)的其他上检索时出现的错误的速度。文件系统缓存活动是大部分应用程序 IP 操作的可靠指示器。这个计数器显示错误的次数而不管每次操作中的出错的页数。
38=Demand Zero Faults/sec
39=Demand Zero Faults/sec 是需要零页面以满足错误的速度。零页面和前面存储的数据被删除并被填满零的页面是 Windows 的一个安全特征，它阻止其他进程看见前一进程使用内存空间存储的数据。Windows 保存一份零页面的列表以加速此进程。此计数器显示错误的数量，它并不考虑为了满足错误而检索的页面数量。此计数器显示上两个示例的值除以实例间隔时间的差别。
40=Pages/sec
41=Pages/sec 是指为解决硬页错误从磁盘读取或写入磁盘的速度。这个计数器是可以显示导致系统范围延缓类型错误的主要指示器。它是 Memory\\Pages Input/sec 和 Memory\\Pages Output/sec 的总和。是用页数计算的，以便在不用做转换的情况下就可以同其他页计数如: Memory\\Page Faults/sec 做比较，这个值包括为满足错误而在文件系统缓存(通常由应用程序请求)的非缓存映射内存文件中检索的页。
42=Page Reads/sec
43=Page Reads/sec 是取读磁盘以解析硬页面错误的速度。它显示读取操作的数量，它并不考虑每个操作的页面数量。当一个进程引用一个虚拟内存的页面，而此虚拟内存位于工作集以外或物理内存的其他位置，并且此页面必须从磁盘检索时，就会发生硬页面错误。此计数器是引起系统范围内延迟的主要指示器。它包含读取操作以满足文件系统缓存(通常由应用程序请求)和非缓存映射内存文件的错误。比较内存的值\\Pages Reads/sec 与内存的值\\Pages Input/sec 来决定每个操作取读的平均页面数量。
44=Processor Queue Length
45=Processor Queue Length 是处理器队列的线程数量。与磁盘计数器不同，此计数器只显示就绪线程，而不是正在运行的线程。即使运行多处理器的计算机只有一个处理器队列。因此，如果一台计算机有几个处理器，您需要将此值除以处理工作量的处理器数量。每个处理器，不管工作量大小，如果保持 10 个以下线程的处理器队列，通常是可以接受的。
46=Thread State

5043=Counters for CLR Garbage Collected heap.
5044=# Gen 0 Collections
5045=This counter displays the number of times the generation 0 objects (youngest; most recently allocated) are garbage collected (Gen 0 GC) since the start of the application. Gen 0 GC occurs when the available memory in generation 0 is not sufficient to satisfy an allocation request. This counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 0 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 1 or Gen 2) GC occurs. _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5046=# Gen 1 Collections
5047=This counter displays the number of times the generation 1 objects are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 1 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 2) GC occurs. _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5048=# Gen 2 Collections
5049=This counter displays the number of times the generation 2 objects (older) are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 2 GC (also called full GC). _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5050=Promoted Memory from Gen 0
5051=This counter displays the bytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter.
5052=Promoted Memory from Gen 1
5053=This counter displays the bytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter. This counter is reset to 0 if the last GC was a Gen 0 GC only.
5054=Gen 0 Promoted Bytes/Sec
5055=This counter displays the bytes per second that are promoted from generation 0 (youngest) to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. This counter was designed as an indicator of relatively long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5056=Gen 1 Promoted Bytes/Sec
5057=This counter displays the bytes per second that are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2 (oldest); objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. Nothing is promoted from generation 2 since it is the oldest. This counter was designed as an indicator of very long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5058=Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 0
5059=This counter displays the bytes of memory that are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1 just because they are waiting to be finalized. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter.
5060=Process ID
5061=This counter displays the process ID of the CLR process instance being monitored.
5062=Gen 0 heap size
5063=This counter displays the maximum bytes that can be allocated in generation 0 (Gen 0); its does not indicate the current number of bytes allocated in Gen 0. A Gen 0 GC is triggered when the allocations since the last GC exceed this size. The Gen 0 size is tuned by the Garbage Collector and can change during the execution of the application. At the end of a Gen 0 collection the size of the Gen 0 heap is infact 0 bytes; this counter displays the size (in bytes) of allocations that would trigger the next Gen 0 GC. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5064=Gen 1 heap size
5065=This counter displays the current number of bytes in generation 1 (Gen 1); this counter does not display the maximum size of Gen 1. Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from previous Gen 0 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5066=Gen 2 heap size
5067=This counter displays the current number of bytes in generation 2 (Gen 2). Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from Gen 1 during previous Gen 1 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5068=Large Object Heap size
5069=This counter displays the current size of the Large Object Heap in bytes. Objects greater than 20 KBytes are treated as large objects by the Garbage Collector and are directly allocated in a special heap; they are not promoted through the generations. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5070=Finalization Survivors
5071=This counter displays the number of garbage collected objects that survive a collection because they are waiting to be finalized. If these objects hold references to other objects then those objects also survive but are not counted by this counter; the "Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 0" and "Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 1" counters represent all the memory that survived due to finalization. This counter is not a cumulative counter; its updated at the end of every GC with count of the survivors during that particular GC only. This counter was designed to indicate the extra overhead that the application might incur because of finalization.
5072=# GC Handles
5073=This counter displays the current number of GC Handles in use. GCHandles are handles to resources external to the CLR and the managed environment. Handles occupy small amounts of memory in the GCHeap but potentially expensive unmanaged resources.
5074=Allocated Bytes/sec
5075=This counter displays the rate of bytes per second allocated on the GC Heap. This counter is updated at the end of every GC; not at each allocation. This counter is not an average over time; it displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5076=# Induced GC
5077=This counter displays the peak number of times a garbage collection was performed because of an explicit call to GC.Collect. Its a good practice to let the GC tune the frequency of its collections.
5078=% Time in GC
5079=% Time in GC is the percentage of elapsed time that was spent in performing a garbage collection (GC) since the last GC cycle. This counter is usually an indicator of the work done by the Garbage Collector on behalf of the application to collect and compact memory. This counter is updated only at the end of every GC and the counter value reflects the last observed value; its not an average.
5080=Not Displayed
5081=Not Displayed.
5082=# Bytes in all Heaps
5083=This counter is the sum of four other counters; Gen 0 Heap Size; Gen 1 Heap Size; Gen 2 Heap Size and the Large Object Heap Size. This counter indicates the current memory allocated in bytes on the GC Heaps.
5084=# Total committed Bytes
5085=This counter displays the amount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently committed by the Garbage Collector. (Committed memory is the physical memory for which space has been reserved on the disk paging file).
5086=# Total reserved Bytes
5087=This counter displays the amount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently reserved by the Garbage Collector. (Reserved memory is the virtual memory space reserved for the application but no disk or main memory pages have been used.)
5088=# of Pinned Objects
5089=This counter displays the number of pinned objects encountered in the last GC. This counter tracks the pinned objects only in the heaps that were garbage collected e.g. a Gen 0 GC would cause enumeration of pinned objects in the generation 0 heap only. A pinned object is one that the Garbage Collector cannot move in memory.
5090=# of Sink Blocks in use
5091=This counter displays the current number of sync blocks in use. Sync blocks are per-object data structures allocated for storing synchronization information. Sync blocks hold weak references to managed objects and need to be scanned by the Garbage Collector. Sync blocks are not limited to storing synchronization information and can also store COM interop metadata. This counter was designed to indicate performance problems with heavy use of synchronization primitives.
5092=.NET CLR Loading
5093=Statistics for CLR Class Loader.
5094=Total Classes Loaded

5102=Rate of Load Failures
5103=This counter displays the number of classes that failed to load per second. This counter is not an average over time; it displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval. These load failures could be due to many reasons like inadequate security or illegal format. Full details can be found in the profiling services help.
5104=Bytes in Loader Heap
